# CS-499 Artifact 2 – Algorithms, Data Structures, Databases & Security

This repository contains Artifact Two for the SNHU Computer Science capstone and supports both Enhancement 2 and Enhancement 3.

The project is a MEAN stack web application originally developed for CS-465 and enhanced for the capstone. Enhancements focus on improving algorithms and data structures through role-based access control (RBAC), as well as expanding database functionality and security with authenticated access, administrative user management, and protected API routes.

Detailed design decisions, implementation changes, and analysis for each enhancement are documented in the accompanying enhancement narratives.
